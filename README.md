# P13 python tools

P13pt is a set of python tools (some helper scripts, rudimentary instrument drivers,
automation software, a plotting tool and a fitting tool for vector network analyzer - VNA -
spectra) that I have developed during my PhD thesis in the P13 lab at École Normale
Supérieure in Paris, France.

It has no ambition to become a full-fledged tool suite, but should rather be seen as
a set of example scripts. If you are interested in data acquisition software for python,
check out [Exopy](https://github.com/Exopy/exopy). The VNA spectra analysis is done using 
[scikit-rf](http://scikit-rf-web.readthedocs.io/), combined with a "home-made" de-embedding
algorithm.


## Components

* Instrument drivers for Anritsu VNA MS4644B, iTest Bilt voltage sources and meters, Keithley
2400 and 2600 SMUs and the SI9700 temperature controller (zilockin.py is not a driver, just
a "frontend" for the Zurich Instruments lock-in driver)
* [SpectrumFitter](https://github.com/green-mercury/P13pt/tree/master/spectrumfitter), a
fitting tool for 2-port network VNA spectra.
* [Graphulator](https://github.com/green-mercury/P13pt/tree/master/graphulator), a calculator
for graphene charge carrier density, Fermi level etc.
* [MAScriL](https://github.com/green-mercury/P13pt/tree/master/mascril), the "Mercury
Acquisition Script Launcher", which is the result of an attempt to "standardize" my
acquisition scripts and facilitate live plotting.
* [MDB](https://github.com/green-mercury/P13pt/tree/master/mdb), the "Mercury Data Browser",
a tool to quickly plot data from text files, not maintainted anymore.
* fundconst.py: some fundamental physical constants for convenience
* n_from_vg.py: to quickly calculate the graphene charge carrier density from gate voltage
* params_from_filename.py: a tool to extract parameters from the filename, see below
* rfspectrum.py: a wrapper for [scikit-rf](http://scikit-rf-web.readthedocs.io/)'s Network
class
* savitzky_golay.py: a smoothing filter (not my work, see in the file)


## Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment, ideally conda (see
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)). The specification file conda-spec-file.txt
contains all the dependencies of this library.
    
If you wish to use the "driver" for the Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier, you should install version 16.04 of ziPython.


## Building the doc

The documentation is work in progress, but in principle you can build it by cd'ing
into the docs directory and executing

    make html
    
Then the doc can be accessed: /docs/\_build/html/index.html


## File name strucure for data files

File names for DC or RF data should contain parameters separated by underscores,
i.e. in the format "...\_name=value\_...". That way they can be extracted as a python
dictionary using **params_from_filename**. Ideally, the filename should start with a
timestamp in the format "YYYY-MM-DD\_HHhMMmSSs\_...".

For example, a measurement taken on the 1st of February 2003 at 12:34:56 pm
with gate voltage Vg=-0.1V would look like this:

2003-02-01_12h34m56s_Vg1=0.1.txt

For readability and easy interpretation by the analysis scripts, the parameter
values should not be stated with units, we assume SI units (i.e. for Vg1=1mV
write "...\_Vg1=1e-3\_...")

It is possible to add parameters without value, they will be added to the
parameter dictionary, but not assigned any value (useful for "flagging" files).


## Data file structure

Values should be separated by tabs ("TSV" format), the decimal point should be ".".

Comments should be at the beginning of the file and preceeded by a hashtag "#".
