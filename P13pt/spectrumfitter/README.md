# SpectrumFitter
The SpectrumFitter was designed to automatically load a series of 2-port S parameters from a VNA measurement,
convert them to admittance parameters, de-embed dummy and thru structures and fit the resulting admittance
spectra with a model.

In that it is very similar to the DFO code developed by Andreas Inhofer (also at Laboratoire Pierre Aigrain),
