## high priority
* app should not block when fitting

* let the user also decide a frequency range in which he wants to fit
* axis forgets history!
* add fit result "grade"
* mention the model in the results file

## low priority
* loading the fitting parameters
* should not use self.parent() in Fitter widget
* the save results section should rather be controlled by the main widget since it manages all the model results too
* no need for signal mapper for sliders, can just update all model values using slider dictionary
* reset_values should not be in the model class
* make icon buttons for navigation etc.
* enable automatic fitting (i.e. for whole dataset + saving params)
* remove redundancy self.dut.f vs. self.f
* error when loading model before spectra
* legend real and imag
* enable user to choose which Y parameter
* we should impose the order of the parameters
* the default fit method could be created automatically / be in a base class
* make a history of fitting values every time they change so that the user can restore what was before fit
