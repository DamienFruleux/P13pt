- improve initial data display (ax limits)

- add automatic folder monitor
- spectrum fitter bug: when data is on C: and results file is on D: (make sure this does not happen, i.e. tell user to
  save on same drive)
- create PyPI and conda packages
- find easy way to create link for SpectrumFitter in Anaconda and add pythonpath etc.

- detect when session was modified (*)

- give priority for full vertical display for fitter
- add reset button for layout

- try to block interface with modal progress dialog for fitting and saving all spectra

- enable the user to change contact resistance without reloading everything (i.e. like changing de-embedding)

- ask user for a file format when saving all spectra images

- indicate in navigator which files are in cache
- indicate in navigator which files have been fitted

- add mag/phase view for all parameters
- add button to unload the model / remove the model curves
- do not crash when trying to save results file without model loaded
- add functions for fitting thru delay and dummy capacitance and for manual thru and dummy deembedding


distribution for windows:
* make sure "updating" works
* figure out icons and models folder for exe file creation
* there is an error message when we execute and close in Win10

high priority:
* file and folder fields should be reset to previous value when browse is cancelled, not to nothing
* enable displaying model on a broader frequency range
* let the user also decide a frequency range in which he wants to fit
* it should be possible to load a read-only fitresults file

medium priority:
* when saving the results, make sure there is no KeyError for filename parameters
* loading the fitting parameters: verify that model params / dataset are compatible
* allow non-integer values for fitting params
* need to be able to modify range of sliders
* reset_values should not be in the model class

low priority:
* make a program that can plot spectra from fitresults (by clicking on datapoints)
* add fit result "grade"
* put a function to export deembedded admittance spectra
* we should impose the order of the fitting parameters
* no need for signal mapper for sliders, can just update all model values using slider dictionary
* in order to support touchstone support, need to scan for s2p files, too
* the default fit method could be created automatically / be in a base class
