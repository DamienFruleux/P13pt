high priority:
* for model, dut, dummy, thru, config should be updated also if the text field is changed
  (not only if browse button is used)
  -> config should be saved on successful load

medium priority:
* add button to unload the model / remove the model curves
* when saving the results, make sure there is no KeyError for filename parameters
* loading the fitting parameters: verify that model params / dataset are compatible
* let the user also decide a frequency range in which he wants to fit
* allow non-integer values for fitting params
* need to be able to modify range of sliders
* the default fit method could be created automatically / be in a base class
* check dataset coherence (i.e. all spectra have same number of frequency points and values can be read etc.)
* reset_values should not be in the model class

low priority:
* make a program that can plot spectra from fitresults (by clicking on datapoints)
* add fit result "grade"
* put a function to export deembedded admittance spectra
* we should impose the order of the fitting parameters
* no need for signal mapper for sliders, can just update all model values using slider dictionary
* in order to support touchstone support, need to scan for s2p files, too
