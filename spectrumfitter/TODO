## high priority
* enable saving/loading the fitting parameters
  file should contain comment section with info on model, dut, thru, dummy files

* no need for signal mapper for sliders, can just update all model values using slider dictionary
* let the user also decide a frequency range in which he wants to fit
* integrate into P13pt
* axis forgets history!

## low priority
* reset_values should not be in the model class
* make icon buttons for navigation etc.
* enable automatic fitting (i.e. for whole dataset + saving params)
* remove redundancy self.dut.f vs. self.f
* error when loading model before spectra
* legend real and imag
* enable user to choose which Y parameter
* we should impose the order of the parameters
* the default fit method could be created automatically / be in a base class
* make a history of fitting values every time they change so that the user can restore what was before fit

## done
X sliders are not updated when changing spectra
X enable fitting
X display units
